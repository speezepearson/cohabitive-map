  - basically recreated https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5qGj8qt7VU / https://github.com/EXPWorlds/Godot-Tutorials 
  - but using a CylinderMesh instead
    - couldn't figure out how to get a hexagonal PrismMesh
  - had to specify a SurfaceMaterialOverride on each SphereMesh3D
  - disks respond to clicks
  - wanna programmatically spawn dozens of the disks in a grid
  - okay, did that, but clicking one changes all their colors
  - so I duplicate the surface override material
